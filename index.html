      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      The Nepean Community Gardens were created in 1991 and they are one of the largest community gardening sites in Ottawa. 
      We have over 200 plots and around 150 gardeners. 
      The plots are available for rent from May through October. 
      <br>
      <br>We have three types of plots available:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Raised beds</b> are 4 by 12 ft.</li>
        <li><b>Annual plots</b> are 20 ft by 30 ft, and are rototilled each spring.  </li>
        <li><b>Perennial plots</b> are 20 by 15 ft and are entirely maintained by the gardener renting them. You can plant annuals in these plots as well!</li>
        
      </ul> 

      If you'd like to rent one of our plots, you can <a href="#" onclick="window.location.href='https://naga.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/signup?client_id=6mkmj7cfc7vd5g04cgm6lrm6ql&response_type=code&scope=aws.cognito.signin.user.admin+email+openid+phone+profile&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmain.d1yypu660eufge.amplifyapp.com%2Fverify.html'">create an account</a> and join our waiting list.
      Raised beds are often available within a year or even mid-season.
      Annuals take an average of 2+ years to become available.
      Perennials are only available to existing members, and they take an average of 3+ years.

      <h3>Upcoming events</h3>
      <h4>APRIL 23      Annual General Meeting</h4>
      Join us for our Annual General Meeting (AGM) and seed exchange at the Tanglewood Community Centre on 30 Woodfield Drive. If you would like to add any items to the agenda, please send us an email.
      
      <h4>APRIL 29    Spring cleanup</h4>
      As with every year, weâ€™ll kick off the season with a cleaning party. Tasks include pruning trees, staking plots, painting tools, picking up garbage and rocks. Snacks and cleaning supplies will be provided.
      
      <h4>MAY 3 / 7    Orientation sessions</h4>
      We will be holding two orientation sessions this Spring: Wednesday, May 3rd at 6:00 PM and Sunday, May 7th at 1:00 PM. Whether you are a new gardener or are looking for a refresher, join us for a tour of the grounds, best practices and Q&A. We will meet at the tool shed.
      
      <h4>JUNE 17    Garden party</h4>
      The garden is an ideal place for people in the community, young and old, to gather, chat, and get to know one another, building ties to make a strong and healthy community. Join our Garden Party on Saturday June 17th at 3:00 PM for music, games, crafts, and snacks. We will also have a seedling exchange table. Come get to know your fellow NAGA gardeners! 
      
      <h4>Compost and Straw</h4>
      We are planning to have compost delivered from the City of Ottawa again this year. We are also having bales of straw delivered to the garden for $8 each ($8.25 if paying with plastic). Dates and times will be emailed and posted on the bulletin board at the garden. 


Food Bank
NAGA has been collecting food for the Debra Dynes house for the past several years. Debra Dynes family house is a multiservice community resource that over 100 people access per day. If you'd like to learn more, visit their website at debradynes.ncf.ca.

Consider 'growing a row' to donate in this year's garden plot! Starting mid-season, there will be a spot in the shed to leave your donations.
